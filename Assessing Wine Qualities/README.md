# Machine Learning Project on Assessing Wine Qualities

Objective: Analyzed chemical properties influencing the quality of wines.

Dataset: The dataset was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

Analysis: Performed Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis on the different attributes of the wine using R.

Models: Built Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict which chemical compounds are affecting the pH levels.

Results: Key factors driving wine quality were alcohol content, sulphates and acidity. SVM performed slightly better than linear model as the pH Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for SVM is 0.1068 and for linear model is 0.1095.
